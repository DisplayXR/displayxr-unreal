.SYNOPSIS
  Sign all DisplayXR-produced binaries in a release folder, then verify the
  whole tree is signed.

.DESCRIPTION
  Signing is driven entirely by the command passed in -SignCmd (sourced from
  the SIGN_CMD environment variable by the build scripts). This script holds
  NO certificate and NO secret. On machines without signing capability,
  SIGN_CMD is unset and the build scripts skip signing — the build is
  unsigned, with no behavior change.

    1. Walk the folder for *.dll / *.exe.
    2. Any binary WITHOUT a Valid Authenticode signature -> sign it via the
       configured signer. Binaries that already carry a valid signature
       (e.g. bundled third-party DLLs) are left untouched.
    3. Re-verify the ENTIRE tree. If anything is still unsigned, FAIL (exit 1).

  -SignCmd receives the file path as a trailing argument. Callers pass a full
  signing command (including their own timestamp authority) via SIGN_CMD; the
  default below is a minimal fallback for ad-hoc use.

.EXAMPLE
  # sign a staged binary tree before packaging
  .\sign-release.ps1 -Path .\_package\bin -SignCmd "$env:SIGN_CMD"

    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string]$Path,

    # Signing command; receives the file path as a trailing argument.
    # Production callers pass a full command (with a timestamp authority)
    # via the SIGN_CMD environment variable. This default is a bare fallback.
    [string]$SignCmd = 'signtool sign /fd sha256 /a',

    # Skip signing files already validly signed by anyone (default). Use
    # -Force to re-sign every binary regardless (overwrites existing sigs).
